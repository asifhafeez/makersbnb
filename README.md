## Analysis

We were tasked with building a clone of AirBnB. This was the first project at Makers where we were given free reign on to do whatever we wanted. Luckily, the team I worked with were brilliant. We managed to use XP Values (Communication, Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect) and Waffle to communicate what needed to be done next. We switched pairs regularly and there were no disputes because we were all working towards the same goal. I really enjoyed working with this team and that's what made this one of the best projects during the course.

I like the freedom that Sinatra gives to developers, rather than in Ruby on Rails where you are sort of forced to work in a certain way. We styled the website throughout the week using Bootstrap SASS, which is why the pages look good. I was mostly interested in the back end of this project and it really helped me understand how databases work and how to use an ORM like Datamapper to communicate with them.

There were some struggles but they mostly involved code and we managed to get through the project by working together and researching anything that we didn't understand. It was also a good way to get to grips with version control and github. Both of which I feel comfortable using now.
